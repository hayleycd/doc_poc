This is simply a proof of concept. I am curious about how to handle versioning off of a single branch. 

## Current docs

The idea is that everything in current docs corresponds to the currently released project. 

There is a callout on the [current page](./current/) that indicates this, and links to the upcoming docs. 

New release
{: .label .label-purple }
New release tags can be used to highlight newest content. 

Deprecated
{: .label .label-red }
Deprecated tags can be used to help communicate about recently deprecated items. 

## Upcoming docs

There is a callout on the [upcoming page](./upcoming/) to let people know that they are browsing docs that are actively being developed. There is a link included back to the current docs. These callouts are included on each child page too, to help make sure people know where they are in the docs. 

Coming soon
{: .label .label-yellow }
Coming soon labels can help indicate areas in these docs that are actively under development.
